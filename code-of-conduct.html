      <h2 id="matz_is_nice_and_we_are_nice">Matz is nice, and we are nice.</h2>
      
      <p>In the same way that Matz has written Ruby with a focus on developer happiness, we are focused on community happiness. The Vietnamese Ruby community is full of wonderful people from a diverse range of backgrounds, and we want to ensure it remains a welcoming and safe environment to all who wish to be a part of it.</p>
      
      <p>Whenever we come together as a community, our shared spaces are opportunities to showcase the best of what we can be. We are there to support our peers - to build each other up, to accept each other for who they are, and to encourage each other to become the people they want to be.</p>
      
      <p>With that in mind, if you are present at any Ruby Vietnam event, whether as an attendee, organiser, sponsor or speaker, we take it as given that you agree to follow this code of conduct:</p>
      
      <p>The Ruby Vietnam organisation is dedicated to providing harassment-free experiences at events and conferences for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, or age. We do not tolerate harassment in any form.</p>
      
      <p>All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate in any circumstance.</p>
      
      <p>Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other members of the community. Be respectful towards others. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for events supported by Ruby Vietnam.</p>
      
      <p>Anyone violating these rules at events may be asked to leave the event without a refund at the sole discretion of the organisers.</p>
      
      <p>If you or someone else is subject to harassment, or you have a concern, please contact the event organisers (who will introduce themselves at the beginning of the event), or member of <a href="/committee-members.html">the Ruby Vietnam committee</a>.</p>
      
      <p>The Ruby community is a welcoming and friendly place – thank you for being a part of it.</p>
      <hr />
      <p>This Code of Conduct has learned and built upon the efforts from many others, both within the Ruby community and more widely. Thank you to all who provided inspiration and feedback.</p>
